## Name

Programmeren 4 ShareAMeal

## Description

This is an API enables users to post and join eachothers meals. To make this possible you can register and login an account. The goal of this api for others to share their meal so they meet new people and waste less food! Save the envirnment!

## Installation

The api is running on a heroku server https://shareamealstant.herokuapp.com/api/. But if you want to run it locally you can use XAMPP and it should work instantly! But you will need to have run the .sql script in the root of the folder. Deploying this code on your own server should not be any different but the ENV variables should be changed!

## Usage

These are the API-endpoints. They are documented on a swagger page. Everything related to the endpoints themselves like required fields are documented.
